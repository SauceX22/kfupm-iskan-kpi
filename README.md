:construction: **_Disclaimer: This project is currently under development._** :construction:

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the KFUPM Housing Services KPI Tracker. This application is designed to calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and track housing units for the Housing Services Department at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM).

## Project Overview :open_book:

This project aims to streamline and automate the tracking of housing units and the calculation of KPIs within the Housing Services Department. By leveraging modern technologies, we hope to improve efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility of data.

Here are a couple of sneak peeks into what we're building:

# This Project is created using Create T3 App + Shadcn Ui

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.
